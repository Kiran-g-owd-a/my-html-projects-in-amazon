# Crowdsourcing UI Prototypes (MTurk-Style Interfaces)

This repository contains HTML-based microtask interfaces designed to simulate
crowdsourcing workflows often used for data collection, validation, and human-in-the-loop
decision-making. These prototypes demonstrate structured form design, clear instructions,
validation logic, and interactive UI behavior built using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

All pages have been recreated using generic content and do not contain confidential information.

## 📄 Project Files

### **1. roar.html**  
:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
A detailed crowdsourcing task interface used for collecting structured store-related information such as:  
- Address lines  
- City, state, postal code  
- Store hours and operating times  
- Phone number formatting validation  
- Latitude/longitude input rules  
- Conditional logic for form fields  
- "Instructions" viewer that opens guidance in a new window  

This page showcases strong use of:  
✔ Form validation  
✔ Conditional visibility  
✔ Input restrictions (no paste, numeric-only fields, masking)  
✔ Instructional UI patterns used in production crowdsourcing tools

### **2. WTS.html**  
:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
A multi-step decision-based auditing interface used for product review tasks, such as:  
- Identifying main image background color  
- Checking image quality issues  
- Title verification  
- Color consistency  
- Conditional radio-button logic  
- Dynamic enabling/disabling of textboxes  
- Progression through multiple task sections  

This file demonstrates:  
✔ Advanced conditional logic  
✔ Multi-question workflow  
✔ Hide/show behavior  
✔ Input validation before allowing submission  
✔ Instruction-driven auditing used in MTurk-style workflows
